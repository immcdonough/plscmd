\title{Biweight Midcorrelation}
\usage{
biweight_midcor(x, y = NULL, c = 9)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Numeric vector}

\item{y}{Numeric vector (optional)}

\item{c}{Tuning constant (default: 9 for 95\% efficiency)}
}
\value{
Biweight midcorrelation coefficient
}
\description{
Computes the biweight midcorrelation, a robust correlation measure that
downweights observations far from the median.
}
\details{
The biweight midcorrelation uses the biweight midvariance and midcovariance,
which are robust measures based on a weighting function that downweights
observations based on their distance from the median.

\examples{
\dontrun{
x <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 100)  # Contains outlier
y <- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
biweight_midcor(x, y)
