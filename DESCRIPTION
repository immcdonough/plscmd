Description: Comprehensive Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis toolkit for
    neuroimaging data. Includes six PLS methods for design-based analysis:
    Mean-Centering Task PLS, Non-Rotated Task PLS, Regular Behavior PLS,
    Multiblock PLS, Non-Rotated Behavior PLS, and Non-Rotated Multiblock PLS.
    Also includes PLS regression for predicting continuous outcomes from
    high-dimensional predictors using SIMPLS or NIPALS algorithms with
    cross-validation, VIP scores, and prediction capabilities.
    Supports permutation testing for statistical significance,
    bootstrap resampling for confidence intervals, multiple imputation
    for missing data, and robust correlation methods for outliers.
    Includes publication-quality visualization functions.
    This is an R port of the MATLAB PLS command line tools developed
    at the Rotman Research Institute.
