Description: Comprehensive Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis toolkit for
    neuroimaging data. Includes six PLS methods: Mean-Centering Task PLS,
    Non-Rotated Task PLS, Regular Behavior PLS, Multiblock PLS,
    Non-Rotated Behavior PLS, and Non-Rotated Multiblock PLS.
    Supports permutation testing for statistical significance,
    bootstrap resampling for confidence intervals, and split-half
    validation for reliability assessment. Handles missing data
    through specialized functions. This is an R port of the MATLAB
    PLS command line tools developed at the Rotman Research Institute.
